Salesforce Admin &amp; basic development project
# Training Institute Management System (Salesforce)

This is a Salesforce project I worked on during my Salesforce training and practice.
The idea was to manage students, courses, enrollments, and fees in one place.

### What I built
- Custom objects for Students, Courses, Enrollments, and Payments
- Relationships between objects
- Record-triggered flows to automate enrollments and fee updates
- Validation rules and basic security settings
- Reports and dashboards to track students and payments
- Used basic Apex where needed

### Tools used
Salesforce CRM, Apex (basic), SOQL, Flows, Developer Console, VS Code

### My work
I designed the objects, created flows and validations, and tested the setup with sample data.

> Note: Salesforce org code is not pushed here. This repo is to explain the project setup and functionality.
