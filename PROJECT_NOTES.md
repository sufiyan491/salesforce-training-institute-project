## How I built this project

I started by understanding how a training institute manages students and courses.
Then I designed custom objects based on that flow.

First, I created Students and Courses objects.
After that, I added Enrollments to connect students with courses.

I used record-triggered flows to automate status updates and fee calculations.
Validation rules were added to avoid wrong data entry.

I tested everything with sample records and made changes when issues came up.
